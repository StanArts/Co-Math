"CoMath" is a mobile application which is in the form of a mathematical game. The game consists of sequences of different tasks, which have to be solved for a given time. The game continues till all tasks are completed or till the time runs out in a given game section. The user can choose what kind of tasks he wants to accomplish either arithmetical or geometrical and how hard a given challenge should be. The different tasks appear in random order. The geometrical challenges would need special instruments so the user is provided with them embedded in the application.The user may use drawing tools or geometrical calculators. Moreover, the game can be played by two players which compete with each other. The application has its own social network embedded in the system to allow the users to share information among them and solve given tasks together.
